# population_genetics
This study investigated 23 autosomal STR loci in 1036 unrelated individuals from America with 408 Vietnamese individuals. Here there are some steps:

Calculate Allele Frequencies (AF) of each of Loci
Use AF as features to calculate fixation index (F_st) - a measure of population differentiation due to genetic structure.
Use Distance Matrix from Fst to cluster the group of population based on UPGMA and PCA at population level.
Use AF features to cluster each of pop at individual level with PCA method
Use allele's values of STRs as features to build Machine Learning models to predicts which pop someone belongs to.
In notebook, we practice step by step above
